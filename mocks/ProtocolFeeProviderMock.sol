/**
 * @title ProtocolFeeProviderMock
 * @notice Mock implementation of IProtocolFeeProvider for testing dynamic protocol fees
 * @dev This contract is used with `_dynamicProtocolFeeAmountInXD`
 *      instructions in SwapVM programs to provide configurable protocol fee parameters.
 *
 * ## Usage in SwapVM Programs
 *
 * Protocol fee instructions must be placed BEFORE balances for correct operation:
 * ```solidity
 * bytes memory bytecode = bytes.concat(
 *     // Dynamic protocol fee BEFORE balances
 *     program.build(_dynamicProtocolFeeAmountInXD, abi.encodePacked(address(feeProvider))),
 *     // Balances instruction
 *     program.build(_dynamicBalancesXD, BalancesArgsBuilder.build(...)),
 *     // Other fees AFTER balances (flat, progressive)
 *     program.build(_flatFeeAmountInXD, FeeArgsBuilder.buildFlatFee(feeBps)),
 *     // Swap instruction
 *     program.build(_xycSwapXD)
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * ## Fee Calculation
 *
 * The fee is calculated as: `feeAmount = amount * feeBps / 1e9`
 * where feeBps is in basis points with 9 decimal precision (0.001e9 = 0.1%)
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```solidity
 * // Create fee provider with 0.2% fee
 * ProtocolFeeProviderMock feeProvider = new ProtocolFeeProviderMock(
 *     0.002e9,           // feeBps: 0.2% in 1e9 scale
 *     feeRecipient,      // address to receive fees
 *     owner              // owner who can update settings
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * @custom:security This is a mock contract for testing only.
 *                  Production implementations should include access control and validation.
